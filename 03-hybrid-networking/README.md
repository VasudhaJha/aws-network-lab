> **Prerequisites: Understanding of Labs 1-2, VPC routing concepts**

## Overview

This lab creates a full hybrid VPC architecture with both a public and private subnets.
Public subnet hosts NAT Gateway and Bastion Host; private subnets are isolated from inbound internet traffic, but have secure outbound internet access via NAT Gateway for tasks like installing packages, fetching updates, or calling external APIs‚Äîall without being exposed to incoming internet traffic.

## Architecture

![Hybrid Networking ](./03-hybrid-networking.drawio.png)

- Public Subnets: NAT Gateway, Bastion Host
- Private Subnets: EC2 Instance (no direct internet exposure)
- Public Route Table: Routes 0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW
- Private Route Table: Routes 0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway
- Fully isolated private networking with controlled outbound access

## You'll Learn

- How to create private subnets that aren't directly accessible from the internet
- How to set up a NAT Gateway with an Elastic IP for outbound internet access
- How to configure route tables to direct private subnet traffic through NAT
- The difference between public and private subnet routing patterns
- How to design a hybrid VPC with both public and private networking tiers
- Best practices for subnet CIDR allocation to avoid overlapping ranges

## Resources Created

- 1 VPC with DNS support enabled
- 1 Internet Gateway (required for NAT Gateway functionality)
- N Private Subnets distributed across multiple AZs
- 1 Public Subnet (hosts the NAT Gateway and Bastion Host)
- 1 Elastic IP (static public IP for NAT Gateway)
- 1 NAT Gateway (managed service for outbound internet access)
- 2 Route Tables (public and private routing)
- Route Table Associations linking subnets to appropriate route tables

## Key Concepts Explained

### Private vs Public Subnets

- Public subnet: Has route to Internet Gateway (0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí IGW)
- Private subnet: Has route to NAT Gateway (0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT)
- Private subnets cannot receive inbound internet traffic

## NAT Gateway Benefits

- Enables outbound internet access from private subnets
- AWS-managed service (highly available within single AZ)
- Automatically scales bandwidth up to 45 Gbps
- Requires Elastic IP for consistent public IP address

## Subnet CIDR Strategy

- Private subnets: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24
- Public subnet: 10.0.3.0/24 (after private subnets to avoid overlap)
- Uses cidrsubnet() function for automatic, non-overlapping allocation

## Route Table Architecture

- Public route table: Routes internet traffic via IGW
- Private route table: Routes internet traffic via NAT Gateway
- Multiple private subnets can share one route table

## Bastion Host

- A small EC2 instance placed in a public subnet.
- Acts as a secure entry point to access private instances inside the VPC.
- Only the bastion host has a public IP; private instances remain inaccessible from the internet.
- You SSH into the bastion first, and from there, SSH into private instances.
- This approach minimizes exposure and follows security best practices for managing access.

## Example Configuration

Create a terraform.tfvars file:

```bash
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
vpc_name = "private-lab-vpc"
num_subnets = 3

tags = {
  Environment = "lab"
  project     = "private-networking"  # Required for resource naming
  Lab         = "03-private-routing"
}
region = "ap-south-1"
```

## How to Use

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Expected Outputs
```

## After successful deployment

```text
Outputs:

bastion_public_dns = "ec2-65-0-184-233.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
bastion_public_ip = "65.0.184.233"
elastic_ip = "13.204.98.82"
internet_gateway_id = "igw-0dae0a9c05021afd3"
nat_gateway_id = "nat-04d7d284f368c737b"
private_instance_ip = "10.0.0.249"
private_subnet_ids = [
  "subnet-0e645e5b87015b60d",
  "subnet-0f059c3b4f2c0ef9b",
]
public_subnet_id = "subnet-09d12a09e31f3ab3e"
vpc_id = "vpc-0234efdebedc7663c"
```

## Testing NAT Gateway Connectivity

## Testing

1. **Connect using SSH agent forwarding:**

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/your-private-key
   ssh -A -i ~/.ssh/your-private-key ec2-user@<bastion-ip>
   ssh ec2-user@<private-instance-ip>
   ```

2. **Test NAT Gateway:**

  Use curl to confirm outbound internet traffic is routed via the NAT Gateway
  
  ```bash
  curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com  # Shows NAT Gateway public IP
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Private instances can't reach internet

- Verify NAT Gateway is in "available" state
- Check private route table has 0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway route
- Ensure Elastic IP is properly associated with NAT Gateway

### NAT Gateway creation fails

- Public subnet must have route to Internet Gateway
- Elastic IP must be allocated to VPC (not EC2-Classic)
- Check if you have NAT Gateway limits in your region

### High costs

- NAT Gateways have hourly charges (~$45/month) plus data processing fees
- Consider NAT Instance for cost-sensitive labs (not covered here)

## Cost Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: NAT Gateways incur charges (~$1.50/day). Remember to run terraform destroy when finished.
